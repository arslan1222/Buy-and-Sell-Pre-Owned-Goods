# Buy-and-Sell-Pre-Owned-Goods
The project aims to develop a user-friendly web application for buying and selling pre-owned goods. It helps individuals sell items they no longer need while allowing others to purchase them at lower prices. The platform promotes sustainability by encouraging product reuse, reducing waste, and supporting affordable, eco-friendly exchanges.
